\section{Study of an Acoustic Rangefinder}
The following state diagram needs to be corrected:

There are two errors in this system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Error (1):} "$\overline{Ir}$" instead of "Ir" – The loading should occur when receiving Ir.
    \item \textbf{Error (2):} "IeIr" instead of "Ie$\overline{Ir}$" – The counting should resume when an Ie pulse is sent and no Ir pulse is received.
\end{itemize}
